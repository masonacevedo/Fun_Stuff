"Exists" pseudo code: 
    Compute Hash of Key

    if elements[Hash] is the empty string:
        return false
    else if elements[Hash] is equal to key:
        return true
    else (in this case, elements[hash] is a non-empty string and is not the key, so we have to do open addressing)
        while (not looking at empty string):
            check if string matches the key
                if it does, return true
                else, advance to next string
                advance to next string
        
        if we're here, then we've seen an empty string and never found a match, so
        we should return false


insert pseudo code: 

insert:
    if key already exists in set, do nothing
    else

    compute hash
    if vector item at hash index is empty string, store it there, and we're done!
    if non-empty, we need to do open addressing
        while (current string is nonempty):
            index++
        now that we've reached an empty spot in the vector, 
        insert the key there

        resize table:
            double bucket size, then choose the first prime after it
